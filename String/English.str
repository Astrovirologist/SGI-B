StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROTRADEPORT1"
	Value "Trade Ports automatically produce autonomous trade ships that transport goods between friendly planets with Trade Ports. Each Trade Port produces credits over time, at a rate that scales with the number of trade ships it has launched."
StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROREFINERY1"
	Value "Like Trade Ports, Refineries automatically produce autonomous cargo ships that scales their resource income. These ships seek out resource extractors belonging to your empire at adjacent gravity wells."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_BUILDREFINERY"
	Value "Because each refinery draws from extractors in nearby gravity wells and each extractor can only support a few refineries, building too many refineries will not increase your resource income efficiently. Go ahead and build one at your desert planet."
StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDRESOURCING_INTROCULTURE2"
	Value "As culture spreads, it causes shifts in allegiance. Friendly culture will cause allegiance to increase slowly to a slightly higher maximum, whereas hostile culture causes allegiance to slowly drop to zero."
StringInfo

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_CANNONMOREINFO"

StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINTRO"
	Value "Ultimately, the best way to protect your planets is with a starbase. Starbases are extremely powerful defensive structures that can assault multiple enemies simultaneously."
StringInfo
	ID "IDS_TUTORIAL_ADVANCEDDEFENSE_STARBASEINFO"
	Value "Starbases are deployed through heavy constructor cruisers. Most starbases cannot move once deployed, so it's important to build the base exactly where you want it."
